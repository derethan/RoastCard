<h2>What is RoastCard? </h2>
<p> Roast Card is an easy-to-use web interface that allows users to create their own custom coffee roasting log to suit their own style and needs.

Users may print or save a log to their computer and load it for future use or modifications. </p>

<h2>How to use?</h2>
<p> Roast Card was designed with craft coffee roasters in mind but can easily be used by anyone. All that is required is an internet connection. Visit the website or download or clone the github repository (open the index.html file), and you will have a couple of choices to get started. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
As a coffee enthusiast and craft roaster, I had always had trouble finding a premade roasting log that I liked, and many that were decent required me to purchase a printed booklet. This led me to often draw out a card on paper or make up something in Excel that would make do. When I started my journey as a software developer with Get Coding, it offered me an excellent opportunity to come up with a solution for a personal hobby and develop my first project at the same time. Building the Roast Card web app was a fantastic experience that allowed me to build on the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and prepared me to dive into the more advanced aspects of web development.

<h2>Technologies:</h2>
*RoastCard was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
