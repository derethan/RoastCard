ToDo List:
    -   make the resizable feature for canvas elements specific to certain elements
    -   Adjust elements to keep them aligned with bottom and right pages when page size is changed 
        (-300px if position is bigger then canvas height?)




        Log Element:

        - Display Element from Placeholder as default when item it first placed
        
         - Load Table section/info into Modal window when editing
         - When saved insert Table info from modal back into the Selected element
