ToDo List:


Element Location Adjustments: Partially done

    -   Adjust elements to keep them aligned with bottom pages when page size is changed 

        - Determine Y Position of the bottom of the page (possibly look at mouse relative function)
        - When Page size is changed:
            - if any elements Y position is higher then the Y position of the bottom of the page
            - translate position of the element accordingly

            Bug:  When the Canvas is larger then the window size it seems to
                  shrink back to a smaller size to fast. Not sure whats causing it.

                  Could be related to css scoll property

                  Test Method: Make a Blank site with just a canvas Div and Resize script


    - Might make more sence to have a fixed height and incoporate 
    a function to add more pages rather then just resize through the API



page Session Storage:

        - Store The elements on the page canvas in session storage in case of page reload.
            -   Option  1: 

                - Call function to Store the Canvas Area when an element is dropped (Possibly onDropActivate in dropzone)
                - Store the Inner HTML of the Canvas (As done with Save function) into a variable
                - Create Session Storage variable and save the canvas-area variable to it.
                - On page load check to see if session data exists for the canvas
                    - If exists then load the HTML into the canvas area
                    - If not load a blank canvas
